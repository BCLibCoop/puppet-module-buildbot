Here is an eample of how to use the module to set up a build master and
two slaves on the same host.

buildbot::master::instance { 'my_master' :
  user        => 'buildmaster',
  group       => 'buildbot',
  project_dir => '/home/buildmaster/buildbot',
  config      => '/vagrant/puppet/files/master.cfg',
}

buildbot::slave::instance { 'my_slave1':
  user             => 'buildslave',
  group            => 'buildbot',
  project_dir      => '/home/buildslave/buildbot',
  master_host_port => 'localhost:9989',
  slave_name       => 'mybuildslave',
  slave_password   => 'password',
  admin_contact    => 'Buildslave admin <user@example.com>',
}

buildbot::slave::instance { 'my_slave2':
  user             => 'buildslave2',
  group            => 'buildbot',
  project_dir      => '/home/buildslave2/buildbot2',
  master_host_port => 'localhost:9989',
  slave_name       => 'mybuildslave2',
  slave_password   => 'password',
  admin_contact    => 'Buildslave admin <user@example.com>',
}

class{'buildbot::install::git':
# defaults to buildbot's git repo
#  source   => 'git://github.com/buildbot/buildbot.git',
}
